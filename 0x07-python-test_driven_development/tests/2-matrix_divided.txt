Usage of 2-matrix_divided.py
================================

This module defines the matrix division function ``matrix_divided(matrix, div)``.

Usage
=====

``matrix_divided(...)`` returns a new matrix that is a copy of the parameter
``matrix`` with all elements divided by ``div``.

::

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [10, 20, 30],
    ...     [40, 50, 60]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
    [[2.0, 4.0, 6.0], [8.0, 10.0, 12.0]]

Note that quotients are rounded to a maximum of two decimal places.

::

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [10, 15, 20],
    ...     [25, 30, 35],
    ...     [40, 45, 50]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 7))
    [[1.43, 2.14, 2.86], [3.57, 4.29, 5.0], [5.71, 6.43, 7.14]]

The original matrix is left unchanged.

::

    >>> print(matrix)
    [[10, 15, 20], [25, 30, 35], [40, 45, 50]]

The function can also handle floating-point numbers.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [2.5, 4.8, 6.2],
    ...     [9, 12.5, -15.3],
    ...     [-8.7, 3, 5.6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
    [[1.25, 2.4, 3.1], [4.5, 6.25, -7.65], [-4.35, 1.5, 2.8]]

Integers and floats can be combined.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, -2.2, 3, 4.4, 5],
    ...     [-6.6, 7.00, 8, 9.999, 10]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, -0.73, 1.0, 1.47, 1.67], [-2.2, 2.33, 2.67, 3.33, 3.33]]

Invalid Matrices
==============

The parameter ``matrix`` must be a list of lists consisting of either ints or
floats. If ``matrix`` is not a list, a TypeError is raised.

::

    >>> matrix = "not a list"
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

    >>> matrix = None
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Note that an empty list will raise the TypeError.

::

    >>> matrix = []
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    []

But an empty list of lists will succeed.

::

    >>> matrix = [[]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[]]

An identical TypeError is raised if ``matrix`` is not specifically a list of
lists.

::

    >>> matrix = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

The same TypeError is raised yet again if any elements in ``matrix`` are
neither ints nor floats.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, "not a number", 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats


Finally, all the rows in ``matrix`` must be the same size. If any rows are
of different sizes, a new TypeError is raised.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3, 4],
    ...     [5, 6, 7]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Invalid Divisors
================

The parameter ``div`` must be either an int or float. Otherwise, a TypeError
is raised.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "not a number"))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

::

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, None))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

``div`` must also be non-zero. Otherwise, a ZeroDivisionError is raised.

::

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
